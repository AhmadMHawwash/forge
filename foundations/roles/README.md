# ROLE FOUNDATIONS

Role foundations define the core identity, behaviors, and instincts of different software development roles. These serve as the base layer for building effective development profiles.

## Available Roles

**Focus**: User interfaces, user experience, client-side performance
**Mindset**: User-centered thinking, component-based architecture, performance by default
**When to use**: Building UIs, implementing user-facing features, optimizing client-side performance

### ‚öôÔ∏è `backend-developer.md`

## Usage in Profiles

Role foundations are combined with enhancements and operations to create complete development profiles:

```
Profile = Role Foundation + Enhancements + Operation
Example: Frontend Developer + [User Advocate, Performance Optimizer] + Feature Development
```

## Role Selection Guide

**Choose based on the primary technical domain:**
- **Frontend**: User interfaces, client-side features, user experience
- **Backend**: APIs, data processing, system integration
