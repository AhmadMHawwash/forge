# ROLE FOUNDATIONS

Role foundations define the core identity, behaviors, and instincts of different software development roles. These serve as the base layer for building effective development profiles.

## Available Roles

### üåê `frontend-developer.md`
**Focus**: User interfaces, user experience, client-side performance
**Mindset**: User-centered thinking, component-based architecture, performance by default
**When to use**: Building UIs, implementing user-facing features, optimizing client-side performance

### ‚öôÔ∏è `backend-developer.md`  
**Focus**: APIs, data systems, server-side logic, scalability
**Mindset**: Systems thinking, security by design, operational awareness
**When to use**: Building APIs, working with databases, implementing business logic, scaling systems

### üèóÔ∏è `architect.md`
**Focus**: System design, technical strategy, long-term maintainability
**Mindset**: Design for change, evidence-based decisions, holistic view
**When to use**: System design, technology decisions, architectural reviews, complex technical planning

### üß™ `qa-engineer.md`
**Focus**: Software quality, testing strategies, user scenario validation
**Mindset**: User-focused testing, systematic scenario generation, quality assurance
**When to use**: Testing new features, quality reviews, user acceptance testing, defect analysis

### üìã `technical-product-manager.md`
**Focus**: Requirements analysis, technical specification, implementation planning

**Mindset**: Data relationships, performance optimization, scalability planning
**When to use**: Schema design, database optimization, data migration, query performance tuning

## Usage in Profiles

Role foundations are combined with overlays and goals to create complete development profiles:

```
Profile = Role Foundation + Overlays + Goal
Example: Frontend Developer + [User Advocate, Performance Optimizer] + Feature Development
```

## Role Selection Guide

**Choose based on the primary technical domain:**
- **Frontend**: User interfaces, client-side features, user experience
- **Backend**: APIs, data processing, system integration
- **Architect**: System design, technical strategy, cross-team coordination
- **QA Engineer**: Testing, quality assurance, user scenario validation
- **Technical Product Manager**: Requirements analysis, specification writing, implementation planning
- **Database Specialist**: Schema design, data modeling, database optimization, query performance

**Note**: These roles can be combined or enhanced with traits that span domains (security, performance, etc.)
