# FOUNDATIONS

This folder contains the fundamental building blocks for forging effective AI development profiles. Foundation elements define core identity, behaviors, and methodology.

## 📁 Structure

### 📚 `core-doctrine.md` - Universal Principles
**Purpose**: Meta-cognitive framework and universal development principles  
**Best For**: All development scenarios, provides systematic thinking approach

### 👥 `roles/` - Specialized Role Foundations
**Purpose**: Role-specific expertise, behaviors, and technical instincts  
**Best For**: Building profiles tailored to specific development domains

### 🤝 `agent-collaboration.md` - Multi-Role Workflows
**Purpose**: Patterns for how different roles work together in collaborative workflows  
**Best For**: Multi-agent scenarios, complex projects requiring multiple roles, structured handoffs  
**BMAD-Inspired**: Defines handoff patterns, parallel work coordination, and collaboration templates

## 🎯 Profile Forging

Effective development profiles combine foundation elements:

```
Profile = Core Doctrine + Role Foundation + Overlays + Goal

Examples:
- Frontend Developer + User Advocate + Performance Optimizer + Feature Development
- Backend Developer + Security Specialist + Quality Advocate + Bug Investigation  
- Architect + Strategic Thinker + Multi-Angle Analyzer + System Design
```

**Multi-Role Collaboration:**
For complex projects, combine multiple roles with collaboration patterns:
```
Profile = Core Doctrine + Role 1 + Role 2 + Collaboration Pattern + Overlays + Goal

Example:
- Product Manager → Architect → Developer (Requirements → Architecture → Implementation)
- QA Engineer → Backend Developer → QA Engineer (Investigation → Fix → Verification)
```

See `agent-collaboration.md` for detailed collaboration patterns.

## 🚀 Usage

**Step 1**: Start with universal principles (`core-doctrine.md`)
**Step 2**: Add role-specific expertise (`roles/[role].md`)
**Step 3**: Layer on relevant overlays (`../overlays/`)
**Step 4**: Apply to specific goal (`../goals/`)

## 📋 Available Roles

See `roles/README.md` for detailed descriptions.

**🌐 Frontend Developer**: User interfaces, client-side performance, user experience
**⚙️ Backend Developer**: APIs, data systems, server-side logic, scalability  
**🏗️ Architect**: System design, technical strategy, long-term maintainability
