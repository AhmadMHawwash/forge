# FOUNDATIONS

This folder contains the fundamental building blocks for forging effective AI development profiles. Foundation elements define core identity, behaviors, and methodology.

## 📁 Structure

### 📚 `core-doctrine.md` - Universal Principles
**Purpose**: Meta-cognitive framework and universal development principles  
**Best For**: All development scenarios, provides systematic thinking approach

### 👥 `roles/` - Specialized Role Foundations
**Purpose**: Role-specific expertise, behaviors, and technical instincts  
**Best For**: Building profiles tailored to specific development domains

## 🎯 Profile Forging

Effective development profiles combine foundation elements:

```
Profile = Core Doctrine + Role Foundation + Overlays + Goal

Examples:
- Frontend Developer + User Advocate + Performance Optimizer + Feature Development
- Backend Developer + Security Specialist + Quality Advocate + Bug Investigation  
- Architect + Strategic Thinker + Multi-Angle Analyzer + System Design
```

## 🚀 Usage

**Step 1**: Start with universal principles (`core-doctrine.md`)
**Step 2**: Add role-specific expertise (`roles/[role].md`)
**Step 3**: Layer on relevant overlays (`../overlays/`)
**Step 4**: Apply to specific goal (`../goals/`)

## 📋 Available Roles

See `roles/README.md` for detailed descriptions.

**🌐 Frontend Developer**: User interfaces, client-side performance, user experience
**⚙️ Backend Developer**: APIs, data systems, server-side logic, scalability
