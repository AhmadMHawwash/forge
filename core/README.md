# Core Foundation

This folder contains the fundamental building blocks that establish the agent's identity, methodology, and operating principles.

**Framework Integration:** `@standards/evidence-standards.md` `@standards/validation-systems.md` `@automation/prompt-router.md`
**Playbook Compatibility:** `@feature-request.md` `@bug-investigation.md` `@code-review.md` `@retrospective.md`

## 📁 Files Overview

### 📚 `core-doctrine.md` ⭐ **FOUNDATION**
**Purpose**: Complete operational foundation with detailed guidance  
**Size**: 915 tokens (optimized for v3.2)  
**Best For**: All development scenarios, comprehensive methodology

**Key Features**:
- 5-phase methodology (Investigate → Plan → Execute → Verify → Retrospect)
- Meta-cognitive checkpoints and enhanced chain-of-thought reasoning
- 4-tier evidence hierarchy (🔴🟡🟢⚪)
- Quality gates and escalation protocols
- Complete philosophical foundation

**When to Use**:
- ✅ All development scenarios (unified foundation)
- ✅ Team training and onboarding
- ✅ Complex, multi-session projects
- ✅ Mission-critical projects requiring maximum rigor
- ✅ Documentation and reference purposes

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation Options

#### Option 1: Global Installation (Recommended)
```bash
# Copy core-doctrine.md to your AI environment's global rules
# For Cursor: .cursor/rules/
# For Claude Projects: Project instructions
# For ChatGPT: Custom instructions
```

#### Option 2: Project-Specific Installation
```bash
# Copy to project root as AGENT.md or similar
cp core/core-doctrine.md ./AGENT.md
```

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Framework Usage
```markdown
# Your global AI rule file
[core-doctrine.md content]

# Then use with any playbook:
🎯 MISSION BRIEF: Implement user authentication system
[agent operates with full framework power]
```

### Enhanced with Directives
```markdown
# Core foundation plus enhancement directives
[core-doctrine.md content]
[testing-focus.md content for quality-critical features]
[security-first.md content for authentication systems]
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**Your core foundation is working when**:
- ✅ AI agent operates autonomously with minimal clarification
- ✅ Evidence-first methodology is consistently followed
- ✅ Quality gates prevent issues from reaching production
- ✅ All phases complete with concrete deliverables
- ✅ Team satisfaction with framework adherence >8/10

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
**Agent asks too many clarifying questions**:
- Solution: Ensure mission brief is specific and measurable
- Verify core-doctrine.md is properly installed as global rule

**Framework not being followed**:
- Solution: Check that core foundation is properly installed as global rule
- Verify playbook mission brief is clearly defined

**Incomplete phase execution**:
- Solution: Verify all required evidence standards are met
- Review escalation triggers in the core foundation
