# PROMPT ROUTER

Automatically compose AI developer profiles based on user requests by selecting appropriate roles, overlays, and goals.

## ROUTER LOGIC

### 1. Analyze User Request

**Intent Classification:**
- **BUILD**: "implement", "add", "create", "develop", "build"
- **FIX**: "bug", "error", "issue", "broken", "failing", "crash"
- **IMPROVE**: "refactor", "optimize", "enhance", "upgrade", "modernize"
- **LEARN**: "analyze", "review", "retrospective", "lessons"

**Technical Domain:**
- **Frontend**: "UI", "interface", "component", "React", "Vue", "styling"
- **Backend**: "API", "database", "server", "auth", "data", "service"
- **Architecture**: "design", "architecture", "system", "scalability", "integration"

**Context Indicators:**
- **Security**: "auth", "login", "security", "encryption", "vulnerability"
- **Performance**: "slow", "optimize", "performance", "speed", "latency"
- **Quality**: "test", "testing", "quality", "reliability", "bug-free"
- **User Focus**: "UX", "user", "accessibility", "usability", "experience"
- **Urgent**: "critical", "urgent", "production", "down", "emergency"
- **Investigation**: "outage", "incident", "root cause", "intermittent", "production issue"

### 2. Select Profile Components

**Role Foundation (Pick One):**
```
IF domain = Frontend ‚Üí foundations/roles/frontend-developer.md
IF domain = Backend ‚Üí foundations/roles/backend-developer.md  
IF domain = Architecture ‚Üí foundations/roles/architect.md
IF domain = Mixed/Unclear ‚Üí foundations/roles/frontend-developer.md (default)
```

**Goal (Pick One):**
```
IF intent = BUILD ‚Üí goals/feature-request.md
IF intent = FIX ‚Üí goals/bug-investigation.md
IF intent = IMPROVE ‚Üí goals/code-review.md
IF intent = LEARN ‚Üí goals/retrospective.md
```

**Overlays (Pick 1-3):**
```
IF context = Security ‚Üí overlays/security-specialist.md
IF context = Performance ‚Üí overlays/performance-optimizer.md
IF context = Quality ‚Üí overlays/quality-advocate.md
IF context = User Focus ‚Üí overlays/user-advocate.md
IF context = Urgent ‚Üí overlays/concise-communicator.md
IF context = Investigation ‚Üí overlays/root-cause-analyzer.md

Always consider:
- overlays/critical-thinker.md (for complex or risky work)
- overlays/pragmatic-implementer.md (for quick delivery needs)
- overlays/strategic-thinker.md (for business-critical decisions)
- overlays/relentless-problem-solver.md (for deep technical problems)
```

### 3. Present Selection for Confirmation

Before composing the profile, present the selected files to the user for confirmation:

**Selection Summary Template:**
```markdown
üìã PROFILE SELECTION

Based on your request: "[User's specific request]"

üîç ANALYSIS:
- Intent: [BUILD/FIX/IMPROVE/LEARN]
- Domain: [Frontend/Backend/Architecture]
- Context: [Security/Performance/Quality/etc.]

üìÅ SELECTED FILES:
‚úÖ Foundation: foundations/core-doctrine.md (always included)
‚úÖ Role: foundations/roles/[selected-role].md
‚úÖ Goal: goals/[selected-goal].md
‚úÖ Overlays:
  - overlays/[selected-overlay-1].md
  - overlays/[selected-overlay-2].md
  - overlays/[selected-overlay-3].md (if applicable)

‚ö†Ô∏è  CONFIRMATION REQUIRED:
Do you want to proceed with this profile composition? 
Type 'yes' to continue or 'modify' to adjust the selection.
```

**Wait for user confirmation before proceeding to Step 4.**

### 4. Compose Profile

**Template:**
```markdown
üéØ MISSION: [User's specific request]

[foundations/core-doctrine.md content]
[foundations/roles/[selected-role].md content]
[overlays/[selected-overlay-1].md content]
[overlays/[selected-overlay-2].md content]
[goals/[selected-goal].md content]
```

## USAGE

**For all requests**: 
1. Analyze user request (Steps 1-2)

3. Wait for user approval before proceeding
4. Compose profile only after confirmation (Step 4)

**User Response Options**:
- **"yes"** or **"proceed"**: Continue with selected files
- **"modify"**: Allow user to request changes to selection
- **"no"**: Cancel profile composition

**For simple requests**: Present basic router recommendations
**For complex requests**: Present router suggestions with explanation of reasoning
**For unclear requests**: Ask user to clarify intent and domain before presenting selection
