# PROMPT ROUTER

Automatically compose AI developer profiles based on user requests by selecting appropriate roles, overlays, and goals.

## ROUTER LOGIC

### 1. Analyze User Request

**Ambiguity Check (First Priority):**
Check if request needs requirement clarification before proceeding:
- **ACTIVATE PRODUCT MANAGER IF**:
  - Feature requests lack specific implementation details
  - Vague or high-level requirements that could be interpreted multiple ways
  - Requests where multiple technical approaches are possible
  - Missing information about user workflows, success criteria, or constraints
  - Any request where assumptions would need to be made to proceed

**Signs of Ambiguous Requests:**
- "Build a feature that..." without specific details
- "Make it work like..." without defining exact behavior
- "Add functionality for..." without user workflow details
- "Improve the..." without specific success criteria
- "Create a system that..." without technical constraints

**Intent Classification:**
- **BUILD**: "implement", "add", "create", "develop", "build"

3. **Prefer 2 overlays** for focused behavior
4. **Skip execution style for trivial changes**

### 3. Present Selection and Compose Profile

Present the selected files to the user, then immediately proceed to compose the profile:

**Selection Display Template:**
```markdown
üìÅ SELECTED PROFILE:
- foundations/core-doctrine.md
- foundations/roles/[selected-role].md
- goals/[selected-goal].md
- overlays/[execution-style].md (if applicable)
- overlays/[context-overlay-1].md
- overlays/[context-overlay-2].md (if applicable)
```

**Then immediately proceed to compose the profile.**

### 4. Compose Profile

**Template:**
```markdown
üéØ MISSION: [User's specific request]

[foundations/core-doctrine.md content]
[foundations/roles/[selected-role].md content]
[overlays/[execution-style].md content] (if applicable)
[overlays/[context-overlay-1].md content]
[overlays/[context-overlay-2].md content] (optional, max 3 overlays total)
[goals/[selected-goal].md content]
```

**Composition Rules:**
- Total overlays: 2-3 maximum (prefer 2 for focus)
- Execution style: Only ONE of (pragmatic/deliberate/zero-trust), or skip
- Context overlays: 1-2 based on specific requirements
- Validation: Ensure no conflicting execution styles

**Execution Flow (for complex multi-overlay profiles):**
When combining 3 overlays, specify execution sequence:
```markdown
## üîÑ EXECUTION FLOW

1. **First Pass:** [Execution Style] - Define approach
2. **Second Pass:** [Context Overlay 1] - Apply specific focus
3. **Third Pass:** [Context Overlay 2] - Add additional perspective
4. **Output:** Apply communication style if included
```

Example:
```
1. First Pass: zero-trust - Verify at each step
2. Second Pass: deep-investigator - Find root cause
3. Third Pass: layered-thinking - Analyze all system layers
4. Output: Present findings clearly
```

## USAGE

**For all requests**: 
1. Analyze user request (Steps 1-2)
2. Display selected profile files (Step 3)
3. Immediately compose and execute profile (Step 4)

**Execution Flow Guidelines**:
- **Include execution flow** when using 3 overlays (helps sequence complex behavior)
- **Skip execution flow** when using 2 overlays or less (simple enough without sequencing)
- **Flow structure**: Execution Style ‚Üí Context Overlays ‚Üí Communication (if applicable)

**Request Complexity**:
- **Simple requests**: Present basic router recommendations (2 overlays)
- **Complex requests**: Present suggestions with reasoning (2-3 overlays + execution flow)
- **Unclear requests**: Ask user to clarify intent and domain before presenting selection
