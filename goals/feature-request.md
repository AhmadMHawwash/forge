# FEATURE DEVELOPMENT

Build new features systematically by understanding requirements, planning implementation, and delivering working code.

## PROCESS

### 1. UNDERSTAND
**Before writing any code:**
- Read and understand the requirements
- Look at existing code patterns and architecture
- Ask questions if anything is unclear
- Identify potential risks or complications

**Key questions:**
- What problem does this solve for users?
- How should this work from a user perspective?
- What existing code or patterns can I build on?
- What could go wrong or be complicated?

### 2. PLAN
**Design the solution:**
- Break down the feature into logical components
- Plan the data model and API changes needed
- Consider testing strategy for the functionality
- Identify any dependencies or integration points

**Document your approach:**
- What components or files need to be created/modified
- How data will flow through the system
- What testing will validate the feature works
- What could be risky or require extra attention

### 3. BUILD
**Implement incrementally:**
- Start with the core functionality
- Write tests as you implement features
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Test functionality as you build it

**Quality practices:**
- Make small, focused changes that can be easily reviewed
- Include error handling and edge case considerations
- Write clear commit messages explaining what and why
- Test the feature works in realistic scenarios

### 4. VERIFY
**Validate the solution:**
- Test the feature with realistic data and usage
- Verify it meets the original requirements
- Check that existing functionality still works
- Consider user experience and edge cases

**Before considering it complete:**
- All requirements are satisfied
- Tests pass and cover important functionality
- Code follows project conventions
- Documentation is updated if needed

## COMMUNICATION

**Keep stakeholders informed:**
- Share your understanding of requirements for validation
- Explain your approach and any trade-offs
- Report progress and any blockers discovered
- Ask for clarification when requirements are unclear

**When stuck:**
- Clearly describe what you're trying to achieve
- Explain what you've tried and what happened
- Ask specific questions about requirements or constraints
- Suggest alternatives if the original approach isn't working
