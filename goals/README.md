# GOALS

Structured workflows for common development scenarios. Each goal provides a two-phase approach: **Planning → Execution**.

## Available Goals

| Goal | Purpose | Phases |
|------|---------|--------|
| [specification](specification.md) | Turn vague ideas into clear specs | Discovery → Specification |
| [feature-request](feature-request.md) | Build features systematically | Plan → Build → Verify |
| [bug-investigation](bug-investigation.md) | Find and fix root causes | Investigate → Fix → Verify |
| [code-review](code-review.md) | Thorough, educational reviews | Analyze → Feedback |
| [retrospective](retrospective.md) | Learn from completed work | Gather → Analyze → Act |

## Two-Phase Workflow

All goals follow a gate-based approach:

### 📋 Planning Phase
- Understand the problem
- Analyze constraints
- Design the approach
- **Gate:** Review before proceeding

### 🚀 Execution Phase
- Implement the solution
- Verify results
- Document outcomes

## Goal Structure

Each goal includes:
- **ROLE** — Task-specific identity
- **DIRECTIVES** — Workflow constraints
- **THINKING PROCESS** — Step-by-step reasoning
- **OUTPUT FORMAT** — Expected deliverables

## Combining Goals with Overlays

Goals define *what* you're doing. Overlays define *how*:

```
Feature Development + Deliberate Planner + Security Specialist
→ Plan thoroughly, with security as a first-class concern
```
