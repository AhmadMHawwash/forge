# FORGE

**F**oundations **O**verlays **R**esources **G**oals **E**ngines

Create powerful, specialized AI developer profiles by forging together modular components. Compose the perfect AI assistant for any development scenario.

## 🎯 Core Concept

**Profile = Foundations + Overlays + Resources + Goals**

```
Examples:
Frontend Developer + User Advocate + Performance Optimizer + React-Node + E-commerce + Feature Development
Backend Developer + Security Specialist + Critical Thinker + Python-Django + E-commerce + Bug Investigation  
Architect + Strategic Thinker + Multi-Angle Analyzer + System Design
```

## 🏗️ FORGE Architecture

### 🧭 Foundations
**Core principles and role identities**
- `foundations/core-doctrine.md` - Universal development principles
- `foundations/roles/` - Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, Architect

### ⚡ Overlays  
**Behavioral traits and specialized capabilities**
- 🧠 **Thinking**: Critical Thinker, Strategic Thinker, Multi-Angle Analyzer
- 🎯 **Quality**: Quality Advocate, Performance Optimizer, Security Specialist  
- 🎨 **Communication**: User Advocate, Concise Communicator, Pragmatic Implementer
- 🎯 **Problem Solving**: Relentless Problem Solver, Root Cause Analyzer
- 🏗️ **System Design**: System Designer

### 🌍 Resources
**Technology and domain-specific knowledge**
- 🛠️ **Technology Stacks**: React-Node, Python-Django
- 🏭 **Business Domains**: E-commerce

### 🎯 Goals
**Mission-specific workflows**
- Feature Development, Bug Investigation, Code Review, Retrospective

### 🤖 Engines
**Intelligent composition and automation**
- Prompt Router - Automatically selects optimal profile combinations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Manual Profile Forging
```markdown
# Combine these components in your AI context:

[foundations/core-doctrine.md content]
[foundations/roles/frontend-developer.md content] 
[overlays/user-advocate.md content]
[goals/feature-request.md content]

🎯 MISSION: Build responsive navigation component
```

### 2. Router-Assisted Composition
```markdown
User: "Build a secure login form with good UX"

Router analyzes → Recommends:
- Frontend Developer (role)
- User Advocate + Security Specialist (overlays)  
- Feature Development (goal)
```

overlays/concise-communicator.md +
goals/bug-investigation.md
```

### 🎯 **Deep Problem Solver**
**Best for**: Complex technical problems, root cause analysis
```
foundations/roles/[relevant].md +
overlays/relentless-problem-solver.md +
overlays/critical-thinker.md +
goals/bug-investigation.md
```

### 🔍 **Incident Investigator**
**Best for**: Production outages, systematic failure analysis
```

```

## 🎛️ Customization Guide

### Choosing Foundations
- **Frontend Developer**: UI/UX work, client-side features
- **Backend Developer**: APIs, databases, server logic
- **Architect**: System design, technical strategy

### Selecting Overlays (2-3 max recommended)
- **High Risk/Complexity**: Add Critical Thinker, Strategic Thinker
- **User-Facing**: Add User Advocate, Performance Optimizer
- **Security-Critical**: Add Security Specialist  
- **Team Communication**: Add Concise Communicator
- **Quick Delivery**: Add Pragmatic Implementer

### Matching Goals
- **Building new features**: Feature Development
- **Fixing issues**: Bug Investigation  
- **Improving code**: Code Review
- **Learning/planning**: Retrospective

## 📊 Profile Effectiveness

**Profiles work best when:**
- ✅ Foundation matches the technical domain (frontend/backend/architecture)
- ✅ Overlays address specific risks or requirements
- ✅ Goal aligns with the actual task
- ✅ Total complexity stays manageable (avoid overlay overload)

**Signs a profile isn't working:**
- ❌ AI asks too many clarifying questions
- ❌ Output doesn't match expected expertise level
- ❌ Responses are too generic or too complex
- ❌ Profile conflicts with itself (e.g., speed vs thoroughness)

## 🔄 Evolution

FORGE grows based on real usage:
- **Add foundations** when new technical domains emerge
- **Add overlays** when you notice consistent behavior gaps
- **Refine profiles** based on what actually improves AI output
- **Update engines** to better match user intent to profiles
