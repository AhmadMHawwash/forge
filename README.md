## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Install Core Foundation

**Foundation**: Add `core/core-doctrine.md` as global AI rule (915 tokens, complete guidance)

### Step 2: Context-Aware Usage

**Simply reference framework files in natural conversation:**

- "Implement user authentication @feature-request.md @security-first.md"
- "Fix login bug affecting mobile users @bug-investigation.md"
- "Refactor payment code for performance @code-review.md"

**No template editing required** - AI understands context automatically.

### Step 3: Adaptive Execution

Framework automatically scales complexity:

- **Simple tasks**: Streamlined 3-phase approach
- **Medium tasks**: Standard 5-phase methodology
- **Complex tasks**: Enhanced safeguards + multi-session support

### Step 4: Evidence-Driven Results

Agent provides verifiable proof (see `@standards/evidence-standards.md` for detailed formats and `@standards/validation-systems.md` for quality standards):

- **Code**: `Modified: src/auth.js:45-67 (added validation)`
- **Tests**: `Tests: 47/47 passed | Coverage: 96.2% | Performance: <200ms`
- **Security**: `SAST: 0 critical | DAST: 0 high | Auth: bypass tested`

### Step 3: Adaptive Complexity

The framework automatically adapts to your task complexity (see `automation/complexity-adaptive-variants.md` for details):

- **🟢 Simple Tasks** (< 1 day): Streamlined 3-phase approach
- **🟡 Medium Tasks** (1-5 days): Standard 5-phase methodology
- **🔴 Complex Tasks** (> 5 days): Enhanced approach with additional safeguards

### Step 4: Multi-Session Projects

For large projects:

- Use `management/session-state-management.md` to maintain context between sessions
- Track progress and decisions across multiple development cycles
- Ensure continuity and knowledge preservation

## 📝 Framework Philosophy in Practice

### The Development Session Lifecycle

**Before:** Ad-hoc requests leading to incomplete understanding, rushed implementation, and frequent rework.

**After:** Systematic approach ensuring complete understanding → thoughtful planning → quality implementation → thorough validation → documented learning.

### The Agent Transformation

**Traditional AI Assistant:**

- Executes commands as given
- Limited context awareness
- Reactive problem-solving
- Minimal quality assurance

**Autonomous Feature Development Agent:**

- Investigates before acting
- Comprehensive system understanding
- Proactive problem prevention
- Built-in quality gates and validation

## 🏆 Advanced Usage Patterns

### Multi-Session Projects

For large features spanning multiple sessions:

1. Use `@retrospective.md` to capture session state and context
2. Begin subsequent sessions with discovery phase to restore context
3. Maintain architectural decisions and trade-offs documentation
4. Use `@code-review.md` playbook for incremental quality improvements

### Team Integration

- Share successful playbook customizations across team members
- Use `@retrospective.md` to align on development practices
- Create project-specific directive modules for team standards
- Maintain shared knowledge base of effective patterns

### Quality Optimization

- Combine testing and security directives for critical systems
- Use concise directive for high-frequency status reporting
- Customize evidence requirements based on project risk levels
- Establish team-specific quality gates and success criteria
