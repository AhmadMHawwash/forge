# FORGE

**F**oundations **O**verlays **R**esources **G**oals **E**ngines

A modular prompt framework that helps developers build better AI coding contexts. Stop writing prompts from scratch—compose proven, reusable components that give AI the right mindset for any development task.

## 🎯 The Problem

When working with AI coding assistants, developers face consistent challenges:

- **Forgetting context**: "Make it accessible" or "consider performance" slip your mind
- **Inconsistent quality**: AI output varies wildly between similar tasks
- **Prompt fatigue**: Writing detailed prompts every time is exhausting
- **Knowledge gaps**: Not knowing what makes a good prompt in the first place

## 💡 The Solution

FORGE provides **prompt components** that combine into specialized AI developer profiles:

**Profile = Foundation (Role) + Overlays (Behaviors) + Resources (Domain) + Goals (Context)**

```
Examples:
Senior Frontend Developer + User Advocate + Performance Optimizer + Feature Development
→ AI that builds production-ready UIs with focus on UX, performance, and maintainability

Senior Backend Developer + Security Specialist + Deep Investigator + Bug Investigation
→ AI that implements secure, scalable services and investigates issues deeply

Principal Architect + System Designer + Strategic Thinker + Code Review
→ AI that evaluates architectural impact, provides clear blueprints, and guides system design
```

## 🏗️ Framework Components

### 🧭 Foundations (Roles)

**Specialized roles for different aspects of software development**

- **Principal Architect** - High-level system design and architectural blueprints, defines boundaries and integration patterns without implementation details
- **Senior Frontend Developer** - Builds scalable, accessible UIs with production-ready code and careful attention to architecture
- **Senior Backend Developer** - Implements reliable, secure backend systems with focus on scalability and operational concerns
- **Senior Database Specialist** - Designs and optimizes schemas, queries, and migrations with emphasis on performance and integrity
- **Senior QA Engineer** - Comprehensive testing strategies combining automation and exploratory testing
- **Senior Product Manager** - Clear requirements with technical understanding and feasibility validation

Architect provides strategic blueprints, while Senior roles focus on implementation excellence.

### ⚡ Overlays (Behavioral Modifiers)

**Behavioral patterns that modify how roles work. Compose 1-3 for focused output.**

#### 🎯 EXECUTION STYLE (Choose ONE)
- **Pragmatic Implementer** - Ship fast, iterate based on feedback
- **Deliberate Planner** - Plan thoroughly, seek approval before execution
- **Zero Trust** - Continuously refine, verify everything

#### 🧠 THINKING & INVESTIGATION (Combinable)
- **Analytical Thinker** - Challenge assumptions, consider alternatives
- **Strategic Thinker** - Connect to business outcomes, long-term thinking
- **Layered Thinking** - Break into system layers for analysis
- **Multi-Angle Analyzer** - Multiple perspectives, find blind spots
- **Deep Investigator** - Pursue root causes, never settle for symptoms
- **Technical Researcher** - Research best practices before building

#### 🛡️ QUALITY & SAFETY (Combinable)
- **Quality Advocate** - Testing strategy, edge case handling
- **Security Specialist** - Threat modeling, security by design
- **Performance Optimizer** - Measure first, optimize what matters
- **Clean Coder** - Readability, maintainability

#### 🏗️ DESIGN & PERSPECTIVE (Combinable)
- **System Designer** - Component boundaries, architectural thinking
- **User Advocate** - User experience, accessibility focus

#### 💬 COMMUNICATION
- **Concise Communicator** - Brief, clear, scannable output

#### 🔥 EXPERIMENTAL 
- **Pressure Cooker** - Emotional framing for maximum effort (EmotionPrompt research - for science!)

**⚠️ Conflicts:** Don't combine Pragmatic Implementer + Deliberate Planner + Zero Trust (contradictory execution styles)

### 🌍 Resources

**Domain and stack-specific knowledge** (extendable)

- **Stacks**: React+Node, Python+Django
- **Domains**: E-commerce patterns and best practices

### 🎯 Goals (Mission Context)

**Structured workflows for common development scenarios**

- **Feature Development** - Understand → Plan → Build → Verify
- **Bug Investigation** - Understand → Reproduce → Investigate → Fix → Verify
- **Code Review** - Focus areas, review process, feedback guidelines
- **Retrospective** - Analyze work, learn from successes/failures

### 🤖 Engines

**Intelligent composition tools** (coming soon)

- **Prompt Router** - Analyzes requests and suggests optimal profile combinations

## 🚀 How to Use

**For LLM Context Engineering:**
- **Keep it focused:** Role + 1-3 overlays maximum
- **Avoid conflicts:** Only ONE execution style (Pragmatic/Deliberate/Zero-Trust)
- **Be specific:** Match overlays to actual task requirements
- **Context budget:** ~2-4K tokens per profile is optimal
- **Sequence complex profiles:** For 3 overlays, specify execution flow (see below)

### Method 1: Copy Components to AI Context

1. **Choose your foundation role** based on the work type
2. **Add 1-3 overlays** for specific behaviors you need
3. **Include relevant goal** for workflow structure
4. **Paste into your AI tool's context** (Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)

**Example: Building a user-facing feature**

```markdown
Copy to AI context:
- foundations/roles/frontend-developer.md
- overlays/user-advocate.md
- overlays/performance-optimizer.md
- goals/feature-request.md

Then prompt: "Build a responsive product card component for e-commerce"
```

The AI will now naturally consider UX, performance, and follow structured feature development.

### Method 2: Execution Flow (For Complex 3-Overlay Profiles)

When combining 3 overlays, add execution flow instructions to sequence behaviors:

```markdown
🔄 EXECUTION FLOW:

1. **First Pass:** [Execution Style] - Define your approach
2. **Second Pass:** [Context Overlay 1] - Apply specific focus  
3. **Third Pass:** [Context Overlay 2] - Add additional perspective
```

**Example: Critical Security Investigation**

```markdown
Copy to AI context:
- foundations/roles/backend-developer.md
- overlays/zero-trust.md
- overlays/security-specialist.md
- overlays/deep-investigator.md
- goals/bug-investigation.md

🔄 EXECUTION FLOW:
1. First Pass: zero-trust - Verify every assumption
2. Second Pass: security-specialist - Think like attacker
3. Third Pass: deep-investigator - Dig until root cause found
```

This prevents behavioral conflicts by clarifying priority and sequence.

### Method 3: Use Pre-Built Recipes

Check `recipes/` folder for common combinations:

- `bug-hunter.md` - For investigating production issues
- `code-reviewer.md` - For thorough code reviews
- `system-architect.md` - For technical design decisions

### Method 4: Router-Assisted (Coming Soon)

The Prompt Router will analyze your request and auto-suggest optimal combinations.
