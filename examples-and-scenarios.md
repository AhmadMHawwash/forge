## ðŸŽ¯ Core Framework Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Standard Feature Development
**When to use:** Building new functionality, implementing user stories, adding features

**Setup:**
```
1. Install core-doctrine.md as global rule
2. Copy feature-request.md
3. Replace mission brief with your specific feature
4. Optional: Add directive based on requirements
```

**Example Mission Brief:**
```
ðŸŽ¯ MISSION BRIEF: Implement user profile management system with avatar upload, preference settings, and activity history
```

### Pattern 2: Critical Bug Resolution
**When to use:** Production issues, complex debugging, system failures

**Setup:**
```
1. Use bug-investigation.md
2. Add concise-communication.md for rapid status updates
3. Include specific error details and reproduction steps
```

**Example Mission Brief:**
```
ðŸŽ¯ MISSION BRIEF: Payment processing fails intermittently with "Gateway timeout" errors affecting 15% of transactions since yesterday's deployment
```

### Pattern 3: Quality-Focused Refactoring
**When to use:** Technical debt reduction, code modernization, architecture improvements

**Setup:**
```
1. Use code-review.md
2. Add testing-focus.md for comprehensive test coverage
3. Optional: Add security-first.md for security-sensitive code
```

**Example Mission Brief:**
```
ðŸŽ¯ MISSION BRIEF: Refactor legacy authentication module to support modern security standards and improve maintainability
```

## ðŸ“š Detailed Scenario Examples

### Scenario 1: E-commerce Feature Development

**Context:** Adding a product recommendation system to an e-commerce platform

**Framework Setup:**
- **Base:** `feature-request.md`
- **Enhancement:** `testing-focus.md` (ML features need comprehensive testing)

**Complete Prompt:**
```markdown
ðŸŽ¯ MISSION BRIEF: Implement intelligent product recommendation system using collaborative filtering and user behavior analysis

## ðŸ“‹ OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK

You are now operating under the **Feature Development Agent Doctrine**. Your mission is to deliver a production-ready feature that meets user needs while maintaining system integrity.

# TESTING-FOCUSED DEVELOPMENT DIRECTIVE

This optional directive enhances the Feature Development Agent to prioritize test-driven development...

[... full testing-focus.md content ...]
```

**Expected Agent Workflow:**
1. **Discovery**: Analyze current product catalog, user behavior data, existing recommendation logic
2. **Design**: Plan ML pipeline, API endpoints, performance requirements, A/B testing strategy
3. **Implementation**: Build recommendation engine with comprehensive unit/integration tests
4. **Verification**: Validate accuracy metrics, performance benchmarks, A/B test framework
5. **Deployment**: Gradual rollout with monitoring and feedback collection

**Framework Setup:**
- **Base:** `bug-investigation.md`
- **Enhancement:** `security-first.md` + `concise-communication.md`

**Complete Prompt:**
```markdown
ðŸŽ¯ MISSION BRIEF: Investigate reports of users gaining unauthorized access to other accounts through session manipulation

## ðŸ“‹ OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK

You are now operating under the **Feature Development Agent Doctrine** in **CRITICAL INCIDENT MODE**...

# SECURITY-FIRST DEVELOPMENT DIRECTIVE

This optional directive enhances the Feature Development Agent to prioritize security-by-design...

[... full security-first.md content ...]

# CONCISE COMMUNICATION DIRECTIVE

This optional directive modifies the Feature Development Agent's communication style...

[... full concise-communication.md content ...]
```

**Expected Agent Workflow:**
1. **Triage**: Assess security impact, contain potential breach, gather evidence
2. **Investigation**: Analyze session handling, authentication flows, access logs
3. **Resolution**: Implement security patches, enhance monitoring, update controls
4. **Verification**: Security testing, penetration testing, compliance validation
5. **Documentation**: Incident report, security improvements, prevention measures

### Scenario 3: Performance Optimization Project

**Context:** Improving application response times for high-traffic endpoints

**Framework Setup:**
- **Base:** `code-review.md`
- **Enhancement:** `testing-focus.md` (performance testing critical)

**Complete Prompt:**
```markdown
ðŸŽ¯ MISSION BRIEF: Optimize checkout API endpoints to reduce average response time from 1.2s to <300ms while maintaining reliability

[... combined playbook and directive content ...]
```

**Expected Agent Workflow:**
1. **Audit**: Analyze current performance metrics, identify bottlenecks, map optimization opportunities
2. **Plan**: Design optimization strategy, establish performance benchmarks, plan testing approach
3. **Refactor**: Implement database optimizations, caching strategies, code improvements
4. **Validate**: Performance testing, load testing, regression validation
5. **Document**: Performance improvements, monitoring setup, maintenance guidelines

## ðŸ”§ Advanced Framework Customization

### Custom Directive: API-First Development

**When to create:** Your team follows API-first development practices

**Directive Content Example:**
```markdown
# API-FIRST DEVELOPMENT DIRECTIVE

## API Design Requirements
- OpenAPI specification must be created before implementation
- API versioning strategy must be documented
- Rate limiting and authentication must be designed upfront
- Consumer impact analysis required for all changes

## Implementation Protocol
1. Design API contract with stakeholder review
2. Generate client SDKs and documentation
3. Implement server-side with contract testing
4. Validate with consumer integration testing
```

### Custom Playbook: Database Migration

**When to create:** Frequent database schema changes in your project

**Playbook Structure:**
```markdown
# DATABASE MIGRATION PLAYBOOK

ðŸŽ¯ MISSION BRIEF: [Replace with specific migration requirement]

## PHASES
1. SCHEMA ANALYSIS - Current state and migration requirements
2. MIGRATION DESIGN - Safe migration strategy with rollback plan
3. IMPLEMENTATION - Migration scripts with validation
4. EXECUTION - Staged deployment with monitoring
5. VALIDATION - Data integrity and performance verification
```

## ðŸš« Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall 1: Skipping the Discovery Phase
**Problem:** Rushing into implementation without understanding requirements
**Solution:** Always complete the discovery phase fully, even for "simple" changes
**Framework Fix:** The doctrine enforces this through mandatory reconnaissance protocols

### Pitfall 2: Ignoring Quality Gates
**Problem:** Deploying without proper testing and validation
**Solution:** Use testing-focus directive and enforce verification checklists
**Framework Fix:** Quality gates are built into every playbook phase

### Pitfall 3: Poor Communication During Development
**Problem:** Stakeholders lack visibility into progress and decisions
**Solution:** Use concise communication directive for regular status updates
**Framework Fix:** Structured reporting templates ensure consistent communication

### Pitfall 4: Not Learning from Experience
**Problem:** Repeating the same mistakes across projects
**Solution:** Always conduct retrospectives and update the framework
**Framework Fix:** Retrospective playbook captures and applies learnings systematically
