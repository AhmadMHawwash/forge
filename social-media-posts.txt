**Title:** Show HN: FORGE ‚Äì Modular Prompt Components for Better AI Coding Contexts

I kept forgetting to tell AI assistants "make it accessible" or "think about performance" until after the code was written. So I built a framework of reusable prompt components that give AI the right mindset by default.

**The Problem:**
Working with AI coding assistants, three issues kept recurring:
1. Forgetting important context ("secure by default", "consider mobile users")
2. Inconsistent output quality on similar tasks
3. Prompt fatigue from writing detailed contexts every time

**The Approach:**
Created composable prompt modules across 4 dimensions:

- **Foundations** (6 roles): Principal Architect (design), Senior Developers (implementation), Product Manager, QA
- **Overlays** (17+ behaviors organized by category):
  - Execution Styles: Pragmatic/Deliberate/Zero-Trust (pick one)
  - Investigation: Deep Investigator, Technical Researcher
  - Quality: Security Specialist, Performance Optimizer, Clean Coder
  - Design: System Designer, User Advocate
- **Goals** (4 workflows): Feature Development, Bug Investigation, Code Review, Retrospective
- **Resources** (stacks/domains): React+Node, Python+Django, E-commerce

Each component contains specific behaviors, technical instincts, and decision-making patterns‚Äînot just generic descriptions.

**Built on prompt engineering best practices:** Chain-of-thought reasoning, explicit constraints, verification gates, and categorized composition to prevent conflicts.

**Example Combinations:**
```
Senior Backend + Security Specialist + Zero-Trust + Bug Investigation
‚Üí AI that verifies everything and thinks security-first

Senior Frontend + User Advocate + Pragmatic Implementer + Feature Development  
‚Üí AI that ships fast while caring about UX

Principal Architect + System Designer + Strategic Thinker + Code Review
‚Üí AI that provides high-level design guidance and blueprints
```

**Pro tip:** Limit to 2-3 overlays for focused behavior. More isn't better!

All components are markdown files you paste into your AI tool's context window (Cursor, Claude, etc.). Battle-tested content based on what actually works.

Curious about others' approaches to consistent AI output quality.

üöÄ **Stop Writing AI Prompts From Scratch ‚Äì Use Composable Components**

After a relatively long while of using AI coding assistants, I noticed a pattern: my best results came when I remembered to set clear context. But I kept forgetting key aspects like "think about accessibility" or "consider performance" until after reviewing the output.

üí° **The Real Problem:**
Developers face three challenges with AI coding assistants:
1. **Context amnesia** - Forgetting to mention important constraints
2. **Inconsistent quality** - Same task, wildly different results
3. **Prompt fatigue** - Writing detailed contexts takes time

üéØ **Solution: FORGE Framework**

Built a library of reusable prompt components that compose into specialized AI contexts:

**6 Specialized Roles** ‚Üí Principal Architect (design blueprints), Senior Developers (implementation), PM, QA
**17+ Behavioral Overlays** (categorized):
  - Execution Styles (pick ONE): Pragmatic/Deliberate/Zero-Trust
  - Quality & Investigation: Security, Performance, Deep Investigator
  - Design: System Designer, User Advocate
**4 Workflow Goals** ‚Üí Feature Dev, Bug Investigation, Code Review, Retrospective

Each component defines specific behaviors, technical instincts, and decision patterns. Not just descriptions‚Äîactionable guidance built on prompt engineering best practices (chain-of-thought reasoning, constraints, verification gates).

‚ú® **Example:**
```
Senior Frontend + Pragmatic Implementer + User Advocate
‚Üí AI ships fast while thinking about UX
‚Üí No need to remind it every time
```

üí° **Pro tip:** Keep it focused‚Äîuse 2-3 overlays max. Categories prevent conflicts (don't mix Pragmatic + Deliberate execution styles!)

**The Result:** More consistent output, fewer clarifying questions, better default behaviors.

It's like having specialized team members on demand‚Äîa security-focused backend dev for auth work, a UX-conscious frontend dev for features, a thorough investigator for bugs.

All open source. Components are markdown files you paste into your AI tool (Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.).

What's your approach to getting consistent quality from AI coding assistants?

## REDDIT POST (r/programming)
===============================

**Title:** Built reusable prompt components for AI coding assistants ‚Äì looking for feedback

**TL;DR:** Made a library of composable markdown files that give AI coding assistants the right context and behaviors by default. Open source.

---

**The Problem I Kept Having:**

Using Cursor/Claude/ChatGPT for coding, I noticed I'd get wildly different output quality based on how much context I remembered to include. Sometimes I'd forget to mention "make it accessible" or "think about security" until after reviewing the code. Then I'd have to go back and fix things.

Also, writing good prompts every single time is exhausting.

**What I Built:**

A framework called FORGE with ~25 reusable components across 4 categories:

1. **Foundations (6 roles)**: Principal Architect (design), Senior Developers (implementation), PM, QA
2. **Overlays (17+ behaviors - categorized)**: 
   - Execution Styles: Pragmatic/Deliberate/Zero-Trust (pick ONE to avoid conflicts)
   - Quality & Investigation: Security, Performance, Deep Investigator, etc.
   - Design: System Designer, User Advocate
3. **Goals (4 workflows)**: Feature Development, Bug Investigation, Code Review, Retrospective  
4. **Resources (stacks/domains)**: React+Node, Python+Django, E-commerce

Each component is a markdown file with specific behaviors, technical instincts, and decision patterns. You paste 2-3 of them into your AI tool's context (max 3 for focused behavior).

**Example Combinations:**

```
Senior Backend + Zero-Trust + Security Specialist + Bug Investigation
‚Üí AI that verifies everything and thinks security-first

Senior Frontend + Pragmatic Implementer + User Advocate + Feature Development
‚Üí AI that ships fast while caring about UX

Principal Architect + System Designer + Strategic Thinker + Code Review
‚Üí AI that provides design blueprints and evaluates architecture
```

**Key Learning:** Don't overload! Stick to 2-3 overlays. More = diluted behavior.

**What Makes It Different:**

- Not just generic templates - each component has actionable guidance
- Built on prompt engineering best practices (CoT reasoning, constraints, verification)
- Categorized to prevent conflicts - execution styles are mutually exclusive
- Battle-tested content based on what actually works
- Copy-paste ready for any AI tool
- Smart composition limits - 2-3 overlays max for focused behavior

Has anyone else built something similar? What approaches have worked for getting consistent AI output quality?

## DEV.TO STYLE POST
===================

**Title:** Building FORGE: Composable Prompt Components for AI Coding Assistants

## The Problem I Was Solving

After months of using AI coding assistants (Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT), I noticed a frustrating pattern:

**My best results came when I remembered to set clear context.** But I kept forgetting key aspects:
- "Make it accessible"
- "Think about performance"  
- "Consider security implications"
- "Handle edge cases"

By the time I reviewed the output, I'd have to go back and say "actually, also consider X, Y, and Z."

**Three core issues:**
1. **Context amnesia** - Forgetting important constraints until after the fact
2. **Inconsistent quality** - Same task, wildly different results based on my prompt quality that day
3. **Prompt fatigue** - Writing detailed contexts every time is exhausting


## The Solution: Reusable Components

Built FORGE as a library of ~25 composable markdown files:

### Foundations (6 Specialized Roles)
Each role defines specific behaviors, technical instincts, and communication patterns:
- **Principal Architect** - System design blueprints, high-level patterns (no implementation)
- **Senior Frontend Developer** - UX-focused, production-ready UI implementation
- **Senior Backend Developer** - API design, security by design, operational awareness
- **Senior Database Specialist** - Schema design, query optimization, migrations
- **Senior QA Engineer** - Testing strategy, comprehensive quality advocacy
- **Senior Product Manager** - Requirements clarity with technical understanding

### Overlays (17+ Behavioral Traits - Organized by Category)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Key Insight:** Overlays are categorized to prevent conflicts!

**Execution Styles (Pick ONE):**
- **Pragmatic Implementer** - Ship fast, iterate based on feedback
- **Deliberate Planner** - Plan thoroughly, seek approval before execution
- **Zero Trust** - Continuously verify and refine, never trust first version

**Investigation & Research:**
- **Deep Investigator** - Never stops at surface symptoms
- **Technical Researcher** - Research best practices before building

**Quality & Safety:**
- **Security Specialist** - Thinks like an attacker
- **Performance Optimizer** - Measures first, optimizes what matters
- **Clean Coder** - Readability and maintainability focus
- **Quality Advocate** - Testing strategy, edge case handling

**Design & Perspective:**
- **System Designer** - Component boundaries, architectural thinking
- **User Advocate** - Always considers the human using the software

**Thinking Patterns:**
- **Analytical Thinker** - Challenges assumptions
- **Strategic Thinker** - Connects technical to business
- And more...

### Goals (4 Structured Workflows)
- **Feature Development** - Understand ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Verify
- **Bug Investigation** - Reproduce ‚Üí Investigate ‚Üí Fix ‚Üí Verify
- **Code Review** - Systematic review process
- **Retrospective** - Learn from completed work

### Resources (Stacks & Domains)
Extendable with tech stacks and domain knowledge

## How It Works

Each component is a markdown file you paste into your AI tool's context (Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.).

**Simple example:**
```markdown
Copy into AI context:
- foundations/roles/frontend-developer.md
- overlays/pragmatic-implementer.md (execution style)
- overlays/user-advocate.md (design focus)
- goals/feature-request.md

Then prompt: "Build a product card component"
```

The AI now ships fast while naturally thinking about UX and follows structured development.

**Pro tip:** Limit to 2-3 overlays for focused behavior. More isn't better!

## Real Examples

```
Senior Backend + Zero-Trust + Security Specialist + Bug Investigation
‚Üí AI that verifies everything and thinks security-first

Principal Architect + System Designer + Strategic Thinker + Code Review
‚Üí AI that provides high-level design blueprints

Senior Frontend + Pragmatic Implementer + User Advocate + Feature Development
‚Üí AI that ships fast while caring about UX
```

## What Makes It Different

**Not just templates** - Each component contains:
- Clear behavioral guidelines
- Specific technical instincts
- Decision-making frameworks (chain-of-thought reasoning)
- Real-world habits and practices
- Built-in constraints and verification gates

**Composable by design** - Mix and match with clear rules. Overlays are categorized to prevent conflicts (execution styles are mutually exclusive).

**Battle-tested** - Based on prompt engineering best practices and refined through real usage.

## The Results

Using FORGE, I've noticed:
- More consistent output quality
- Fewer "actually, also consider..." clarifications
- Less prompt fatigue
- Better default behaviors (security, accessibility, performance)

## Try It

The framework is open source and ready to use. Each file is copy-paste ready for your AI tool.

## REDDIT POST (r/MachineLearning)
==================================

**Title:** Compositional prompt framework for consistent AI coding assistant behavior ‚Äì methodology feedback?

**TL;DR:** Built ~25 reusable prompt components that compose into specialized contexts for coding LLMs. Seeing improved consistency. Looking for feedback on approach and related work.

## Problem Space

Working with coding LLMs (Claude, GPT-4, Cursor), observed three recurring issues:
1. **Context dependency**: Output quality varies significantly based on prompt completeness
2. **Inconsistent behavior**: Same task yields different quality levels across sessions  
3. **Cognitive overhead**: Writing comprehensive prompts for every interaction is taxing

## Approach

Developed a compositional framework with orthogonal components:

**Foundations (6)**: Role-based behavioral templates 
- Principal Architect (design), Senior Developers (implementation), PM, QA
- Each defines specific behaviors, technical instincts, communication patterns
- ~50-90 lines of actionable guidance per role

**Overlays (17+)**: Behavior modifiers organized by category to prevent semantic conflicts
- Execution Styles (mutually exclusive): Pragmatic/Deliberate/Zero-Trust
- Investigation: Deep Investigator, Technical Researcher
- Quality: Security Specialist, Performance Optimizer, Clean Coder, etc.
- Design: System Designer, User Advocate
- ~30-90 lines each, focused on specific capabilities

**Goals (4)**: Workflow structures for common scenarios
- Feature Development, Bug Investigation, Code Review, Retrospective
- Provides systematic process frameworks

**Resources**: Stack/domain-specific knowledge (extendable)

## Key Design Decisions

**Categorized Orthogonality**: Components are composable within constraints
- Most overlays can enhance any foundation
- Execution styles are mutually exclusive to prevent contradictory directives
- Category system reduces semantic conflicts
- Composition limit (2-3 overlays) prevents diluted behavior
- Controlled combinations from categorized components

**Actionable content**: Not generic descriptions
- Chain-of-thought reasoning frameworks
- Concrete behavioral guidelines with constraints
- Real-world habit patterns
- Built-in verification gates

**Format**: Markdown files users paste into context windows
- Simple integration with any LLM tool
- Human-readable and editable
- Version controllable

## Observed Results

Using compositions vs generic prompts:
- Reduced clarification rounds (~30-40% fewer follow-ups)
- More consistent output quality across sessions
- Better default behaviors (security, accessibility, performance considerations)
- Lower prompt engineering cognitive load

## Questions

1. **Related work**: Are there established frameworks for compositional LLM specialization via prompt engineering?

2. **Evaluation methodology**: How would you rigorously measure consistency in LLM behavioral patterns across similar tasks?

3. **Orthogonality**: Experience with dimension decomposition in prompt composition? Trade-offs observed?

4. **Alternative approaches**: What other methods have shown promise for consistent specialized LLM behavior?

Appreciate pointers to related research or feedback on the approach.
