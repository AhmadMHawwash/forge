## üîÑ SESSION TRANSITION PROTOCOLS

### Starting a New Session
```markdown
## SESSION STARTUP CHECKLIST
- [ ] Review project state from last session
- [ ] Validate current system state hasn't changed
- [ ] Confirm previous session's work is still valid
- [ ] Identify any new constraints or requirements
- [ ] Update project state with any changes

**Context Refresh Questions**:
1. Has anything changed in the system since last session?
2. Are there new requirements or constraints?
3. Did stakeholders provide feedback on previous work?
4. Are there new blockers or dependencies?
```

### Ending a Session
```markdown
## SESSION CLOSURE CHECKLIST
- [ ] Update project state with all progress made
- [ ] Document key decisions and their rationale
- [ ] Capture any new risks or issues identified
- [ ] Define clear next steps for continuation
- [ ] Archive evidence from this session

**Handover Preparation**:
1. What was accomplished this session?
2. What are the immediate priorities for next session?
3. What context will be critical to remember?
4. Are there any time-sensitive dependencies?
```

## üìä STATE TRACKING AUTOMATION

### Progress Indicators
```markdown
## PROGRESS DASHBOARD
**Overall Progress**: [Progress bar: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë] 80%

**Phase Breakdown**:
- Investigate: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà 100% ‚úÖ
- Plan: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà 100% ‚úÖ  
- Execute: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 70% üöß
- Verify: ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 0% ‚è≥
- Retrospect: ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 0% ‚è≥

**Quality Gates Status**:
- Requirements Clarity: ‚úÖ PASSED
- Architecture Review: ‚úÖ PASSED
- Code Quality: üöß IN PROGRESS
- Test Coverage: ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS ATTENTION
- Performance: ‚è≥ PENDING
```

### Velocity Tracking
```markdown
## VELOCITY METRICS
**Session Performance**:
- Sessions Planned: 5
- Sessions Completed: 3
- Velocity: 1.2 phases per session
- Estimated Remaining: 2 sessions

**Quality Metrics**:
- Rework Rate: 5% (target: <10%)
- Defect Density: 0.1 per KLOC
- Test Coverage: 85% (target: >90%)
```

## üß© CONTEXT COMPRESSION TECHNIQUES

### Essential Context Only
**Principle**: Include only information that affects future decisions

```markdown
## COMPRESSED STATE (For Token Efficiency)
**Project**: [Name] | **Phase**: [Current] | **Progress**: [X]%

**Critical Context**:
- **Architecture**: [Key design decision]
- **Constraints**: [Must-know limitations]
- **Current Focus**: [Active work]
- **Next Session**: [Priority #1]

**Evidence Links**:
- Code: [file:/path/to/main.js:123-145]
- Tests: [91% coverage, all passing]
- Performance: [245ms avg, target: <300ms]
```

### Smart Context Inheritance
```markdown
## CONTEXT INHERITANCE RULES
1. **Always Include**: Current phase, active work, blockers
2. **Include if Changed**: Requirements, architecture decisions, constraints
3. **Archive if Stable**: Completed phases, resolved issues, old evidence
4. **Compress if Large**: Long investigation results, detailed test outputs
```

## üîß STATE MANAGEMENT TOOLS

### State Validation
```markdown
## STATE CONSISTENCY CHECK
Before proceeding, verify:
- [ ] Project state reflects actual system state
- [ ] All claimed completed work is verifiable
- [ ] Dependencies are still accurate
- [ ] Constraints haven't changed
- [ ] Evidence is still accessible
```

### State Evolution Tracking
```markdown
## STATE CHANGE LOG
| Session | Changes Made | Decisions | Issues |
|---------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Initial investigation | Tech stack choice | None |
| 2 | Architecture design | Database schema | Performance concerns |
| 3 | Core implementation | Error handling approach | Integration complexity |
```

### Recovery Procedures
```markdown
## STATE RECOVERY PROTOCOLS

**If State is Lost**:
1. Examine codebase for evidence of previous work
2. Review commit history and PR descriptions  
3. Check documentation for architectural decisions
4. Validate current system against known requirements
5. Reconstruct minimal state needed to proceed

**If State is Inconsistent**:
1. Identify discrepancies between state and reality
2. Validate each claim against evidence
3. Update state to reflect actual situation
4. Document what caused the inconsistency
5. Adjust process to prevent recurrence
```

## üéØ STATE MANAGEMENT SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Effective state management achieved when**:
- Context is preserved across sessions without information loss
- New sessions can start immediately without re-investigation
- Decisions and rationale are traceable
- Progress is accurately tracked and predictable
- Evidence remains accessible and verifiable

---

**üéØ PRESERVE CONTEXT. MAINTAIN MOMENTUM. ENSURE CONTINUITY.**
