```markdown
## MEASUREMENT CRITERIA
**Score 10**: All requirements clear, no clarification needed
**Score 8-9**: 1-2 minor clarifications required

**Score 4-5**: Significant ambiguity, multiple clarification rounds
**Score 1-3**: Requirements fundamentally unclear, major rework needed

## TRACKING
- **Baseline**: Pre-framework average
- **Target**: >8.0 consistently
- **Measurement**: Count clarification questions/total requirements
```

#### **First-Time Implementation Success Rate**
```markdown
## DEFINITION
Percentage of features/fixes that meet acceptance criteria without rework

## CALCULATION
Success Rate = (Features passing first review / Total features) Ã— 100

## TARGETS
- **Minimum Acceptable**: 70%
- **Good Performance**: 85%
- **Excellent Performance**: 95%
```

#### **Estimation Accuracy**
```markdown
## MEASUREMENT
Actual effort vs. estimated effort ratio

## CALCULATION
Accuracy = 1 - |Actual - Estimated| / Estimated

## TARGETS
- **Acceptable**: >80% accuracy (within 20% of estimate)
- **Good**: >90% accuracy (within 10% of estimate)  
- **Excellent**: >95% accuracy (within 5% of estimate)
```

### 2. Quality Metrics

#### **Defect Density**
```markdown
## MEASUREMENT
Defects per 1000 lines of code (KLOC) in production

## TRACKING
- **Pre-Framework Baseline**: [Establish team baseline]
- **Target Improvement**: 50% reduction within 6 months
- **World-Class Benchmark**: <0.1 defects per KLOC
```

#### **Test Coverage Effectiveness**
```markdown
## MEASUREMENT
- **Coverage Percentage**: Lines covered by tests
- **Coverage Quality**: Defects caught by tests vs. production defects

## TARGETS
- **Coverage Target**: >90% for business logic
- **Effectiveness Target**: >95% of defects caught pre-production
```

#### **Code Quality Score**
```markdown
## MEASUREMENT COMPONENTS
- Cyclomatic complexity (target: <10 per function)
- Code duplication (target: <5%)
- Technical debt ratio (target: <30 minutes per hour of development)
- Maintainability index (target: >70)

## COMPOSITE SCORE
Quality Score = (Complexity Score + Duplication Score + Debt Score + Maintainability Score) / 4
```

### 3. Process Efficiency Metrics

#### **Framework Adherence Rate**
```markdown
## MEASUREMENT
Percentage of projects following complete framework methodology

## TRACKING
- **Phase Completion**: All phases documented with evidence
- **Quality Gates**: All mandatory checks performed
- **Evidence Standards**: Concrete proof provided for all claims

## TARGET
- **Minimum**: 80% adherence for critical projects
- **Goal**: 95% adherence across all projects
```

#### **Time-to-Value**
```markdown
## MEASUREMENT
Time from feature request to user value delivery

## BENCHMARKS
- **Simple Features**: <3 days
- **Medium Features**: <2 weeks  
- **Complex Features**: <6 weeks

## IMPROVEMENT TARGET
20% reduction in time-to-value within 3 months
```

## ðŸ“ˆ ADVANCED ANALYTICS

### Framework ROI Calculation
```markdown
## ROI COMPONENTS

**Costs**:
- Framework development time: [X hours]
- Team training time: [Y hours]  
- Additional process overhead: [Z hours per project]

**Benefits**:
- Reduced rework time: [Hours saved per project]
- Faster development cycles: [Hours saved per project]
- Higher quality (reduced defect fixing): [Hours saved]
- Improved stakeholder satisfaction: [Estimated value]

## ROI FORMULA
ROI = (Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs Ã— 100

## TARGET
Positive ROI within 3 months, >200% ROI within 6 months
```

### Predictive Quality Indicators
```markdown
## LEADING INDICATORS
- **Discovery Phase Thoroughness**: Correlation with final quality
- **Planning Detail Level**: Correlation with execution smoothness  
- **Test Coverage Early**: Correlation with defect rates
- **Evidence Quality**: Correlation with project success

## TRACKING
Monitor leading indicators to predict and prevent issues before they occur
```
