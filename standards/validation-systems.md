# FRAMEWORK VALIDATION SYSTEMS

**üéØ PURPOSE**: Ensure correct framework usage, catch errors early, and maintain quality standards across all implementations.

---

## üîç PRE-EXECUTION VALIDATION

### Mission Brief Validation
```markdown
## MISSION BRIEF QUALITY CHECKLIST
- [ ] **Specificity**: Contains concrete, measurable objectives
- [ ] **Scope**: Clearly bounded and achievable  
- [ ] **Context**: Provides sufficient background information
- [ ] **Success Criteria**: Implicit or explicit acceptance criteria
- [ ] **Urgency**: Appropriate priority level indicated

## VALIDATION RULES
**PASS Examples**:
- ‚úÖ "Implement OAuth2 authentication with Google and GitHub providers, including user profile sync"
- ‚úÖ "Fix intermittent 500 errors in payment processing affecting 15% of checkout attempts"
- ‚úÖ "Refactor UserService class to reduce cyclomatic complexity from 25 to <10"

**FAIL Examples**:
- ‚ùå "Make the app better" (too vague)
- ‚ùå "Fix the bug" (insufficient context)
- ‚ùå "Add some features" (no specificity)
```

### Framework Component Validation
```markdown
## COMPONENT SELECTION VALIDATION

- [ ] **Scope Alignment**: Playbook complexity matches task scope
- [ ] **Team Readiness**: Team can execute chosen playbook effectively

### Directive Combination Validation  
- [ ] **Compatibility Check**: No conflicting directives selected
- [ ] **Context Appropriateness**: Directives match project context
- [ ] **Token Budget**: Total combination under 15,000 tokens
- [ ] **Value Justification**: Each directive adds clear value

### Required Information Validation
- [ ] **System Context**: Current state and constraints documented
- [ ] **Stakeholder Input**: Required approvals and feedback channels identified
- [ ] **Resource Availability**: Team capacity and timeline confirmed

- [ ] **Test Quality**: Tests actually validate intended functionality

**Performance Evidence**: `metric:measurement:value:target:status`

### Evidence Validation Automation
```bash
# Automated Evidence Checker (Pseudocode)
validate_evidence() {
    for evidence in evidence_list:
        if evidence.type == "file":
            assert file_exists(evidence.path)
            assert lines_exist(evidence.start, evidence.end)
        elif evidence.type == "test":
            assert test_command_valid(evidence.command)
            assert coverage_adequate(evidence.coverage)
        elif evidence.type == "metric":
            assert metric_reasonable(evidence.value)
            assert target_comparison_valid(evidence.target)
}
```
```

## üîß AUTOMATED VALIDATION TOOLS

### Pre-Flight Validation Script
```markdown
## FRAMEWORK VALIDATION SCRIPT

### Input Validation
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Framework Pre-Flight Check

echo "üîç FRAMEWORK VALIDATION STARTING..."

# Check 1: Mission Brief Quality
if grep -q "Replace this line" mission_brief.txt; then
    echo "‚ùå Mission brief not customized"
    exit 1
fi

# Check 2: Component Compatibility
python validate_directives.py --check-compatibility

# Check 3: Token Count
total_tokens=$(wc -w combined_prompt.txt | awk '{print $1}')
if [ $total_tokens -gt 15000 ]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Token count ($total_tokens) exceeds recommended limit"
fi

# Check 4: Required Context
if [ ! -f "project_context.md" ]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  No project context file found"
fi

echo "‚úÖ Pre-flight validation complete"
```

### Quality Gate Automation
```yaml
# CI/CD Integration Example
framework_validation:
  stage: validate
  script:
    - python framework_validator.py
    - check_evidence_quality.py
    - validate_test_coverage.py
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "framework_session"
  allow_failure: false
```
```

### Real-Time Validation Feedback
```markdown
## VALIDATION FEEDBACK SYSTEM

### During Prompt Construction
```markdown
**REAL-TIME CHECKS**:
- ‚úÖ Mission brief is specific and measurable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Token count approaching limit (12,500/15,000)  
- ‚ùå Conflicting directives detected: concise-communication + testing-focus in planning phase
- ‚úÖ All required project context provided

**RECOMMENDATIONS**:
- Use optimized core-doctrine.md for maximum efficiency
- Split into two sessions: planning with full detail, execution with concise communication
```

### Post-Execution Validation
```markdown
**COMPLETION CHECKLIST AUTOMATION**:
- [ ] All phase deliverables present: ‚úÖ Automated check
- [ ] Evidence format compliance: ‚úÖ Automated check  
- [ ] Quality gates passed: ‚ö†Ô∏è  2 of 8 gates need manual review
- [ ] Documentation updated: ‚ùå 3 files need updates

**NEXT STEPS**:
1. Complete manual review of flagged quality gates
2. Update documentation for modified components
3. Run final validation before session closure
```
