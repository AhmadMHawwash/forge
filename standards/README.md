# Framework Standards

This folder contains framework-wide standards, validation rules, and quality gates that ensure consistent, high-quality implementation across all development scenarios.

**Framework Integration:** Universal application across all `@core/`, `@tactics/`, `@strategies/`, and `@automation/` components
**Quality Assurance:** Automated validation and error prevention for framework usage

## 📁 Files Overview

### 📊 `evidence-standards.md` ⭐ **CORE STANDARD**
**Purpose**: Establish precise, verifiable evidence formats for all claims and decisions  
**Scope**: Universal - applies to all development phases and framework components  
**Integration**: Referenced by `@core-doctrine.md` 4-tier evidence hierarchy

**Key Features**:
- Standardized evidence taxonomy (5 phases: Investigative → Design → Implementation → Verification → Learning)
- Automated evidence collection protocols and validation
- Quality scoring algorithms and freshness standards
- Complete evidence lifecycle management

**When to Use**:
- ✅ All development scenarios requiring proof and validation
- ✅ Quality audits and compliance requirements
- ✅ Multi-session project documentation
- ✅ Team training on evidence-based development

### 🎯 `directive-compatibility-matrix.md`
**Purpose**: Prevent conflicts and guide optimal combinations of framework components  
**Scope**: Automation system for safe framework composition  
**Integration**: Used by `@automation/prompt-router.md` for intelligent recommendations

**Key Features**:
- Comprehensive compatibility rules for all tactics and strategies
- Recommended high-value combinations with use cases
- Token cost analysis and optimization guidance
- Context-aware usage recommendations

**When to Use**:
- ✅ Complex framework compositions with multiple tactics
- ✅ Team onboarding to understand component interactions
- ✅ Framework optimization and token budget management
- ✅ Quality assurance for framework implementations

### ✅ `validation-systems.md`
**Purpose**: Automated quality checks and error prevention for framework usage  
**Scope**: Pre-execution validation and real-time quality monitoring  
**Integration**: Universal validation layer for all framework components

**Key Features**:
- Mission brief quality validation protocols
- Component selection and combination validation
- Real-time execution monitoring and error detection
- Quality gate enforcement with automated feedback

**When to Use**:
- ✅ All framework implementations (automated integration)
- ✅ Team training on framework quality standards
- ✅ Debugging framework usage issues
- ✅ Continuous improvement and optimization

## 🎯 Standards Hierarchy

### Universal Standards (Apply to All Components)
- **Evidence Requirements**: `@evidence-standards.md` formats
- **Quality Gates**: `@validation-systems.md` checkpoints
- **Component Safety**: `@directive-compatibility-matrix.md` rules

### Implementation Guidelines
1. **Always validate** framework usage against standards before execution
2. **Document evidence** using standardized formats throughout development
3. **Check compatibility** when combining multiple framework components
4. **Monitor quality** continuously and adjust based on validation feedback

## 🚀 Quick Reference

### For Developers
```bash
# Before starting any development work:
1. Review mission brief against validation-systems.md checklist
2. Select framework components using directive-compatibility-matrix.md
3. Document all evidence using evidence-standards.md formats
```

### For Framework Maintainers
```bash
# When updating framework components:
1. Update compatibility matrix for new components
2. Add validation rules for new features
3. Ensure evidence standards cover new scenarios
4. Test all combinations against quality gates
```
