**üéØ PURPOSE**: Guide safe and effective directive combinations to prevent conflicts and maximize framework effectiveness.

## üìä COMPATIBILITY MATRIX

### Base Playbook Compatibility

| Playbook | Compatible Directives | Conflicting Directives | Notes |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------|-------|
| **feature-request.md** | testing-focus + security-first | concise-communication (reduces planning detail) | Use concise only for status updates in long projects |
| **bug-investigation.md** | concise-communication + security-first | testing-focus (slows emergency response) | Testing focus acceptable for non-critical bugs |
| **code-review.md** | testing-focus + security-first + concise-communication | None (all complement refactoring) | All directives enhance code improvement goals |
| **retrospective.md** | concise-communication | testing-focus + security-first (irrelevant to analysis) | Focus on communication efficiency for retrospectives |

### Directive-to-Directive Compatibility

| Primary Directive | Secondary Directive | Compatibility | Reasoning |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|-----------|
| **concise-communication** | testing-focus | ‚ö†Ô∏è CONDITIONAL | Conflicts during planning/design phases; compatible during execution |
| **concise-communication** | security-first | ‚úÖ COMPATIBLE | Security analysis can be communicated concisely |
| **concise-communication** | strategic-tactical | ‚ö†Ô∏è CONDITIONAL | Strategic analysis needs detail, tactical execution can be concise |
| **concise-communication** | critical-review | ‚ùå CONFLICTING | Critical analysis requires detailed explanation |
| **testing-focus** | security-first | ‚úÖ SYNERGISTIC | Security testing is critical; both enhance quality |
| **testing-focus** | strategic-tactical | ‚úÖ COMPATIBLE | Quality strategy aligns with strategic thinking |
| **testing-focus** | critical-review | ‚úÖ SYNERGISTIC | Critical review enhances testing rigor |
| **security-first** | strategic-tactical | ‚úÖ COMPATIBLE | Security constraints enhance strategic analysis |
| **security-first** | critical-review | ‚úÖ SYNERGISTIC | Critical review enhances security validation |
| **strategic-tactical** | critical-review | ‚úÖ SYNERGISTIC | Critical analysis enhances strategic decision quality |

## üéØ RECOMMENDED COMBINATIONS

### High-Value Combinations

#### ü•á **The Quality Triad**
**Combination**: `testing-focus + security-first + feature-request`
**When to Use**: Mission-critical features, financial systems, healthcare applications
**Benefits**: Maximum quality assurance with comprehensive security coverage
**Token Cost**: HIGH (~12,000 tokens)
```markdown
# Use for:
- Payment processing systems
- Authentication/authorization features  
- Medical record management
- Financial reporting systems
```

#### ü•à **The Emergency Response**
**Combination**: `concise-communication + security-first + bug-investigation`
**When to Use**: Production security incidents, critical system failures
**Benefits**: Rapid response with security focus and efficient communication
**Token Cost**: MEDIUM (~8,000 tokens)
```markdown
# Use for:
- Security breach investigations
- Authentication system failures
- Data integrity issues
- Compliance violations
```

#### ü•â **The Efficiency Stack**
**Combination**: `concise-communication + code-review`
**When to Use**: Routine code improvements, technical debt reduction
**Benefits**: Fast iteration with clear progress tracking
**Token Cost**: LOW (~6,000 tokens)
```markdown
# Use for:
- Regular refactoring sessions
- Code quality improvements
- Documentation updates
- Performance optimizations
```

### Context-Specific Combinations

#### üîí **Security-Critical Development**
```markdown
**Base**: feature-request.md
**Directives**: security-first + testing-focus
**Avoid**: concise-communication (security requires detailed analysis)
**Best For**: Auth systems, payment processing, sensitive data handling
```

#### ‚ö° **Rapid Response Mode**
```markdown
**Base**: bug-investigation.md  
**Directives**: concise-communication
**Avoid**: testing-focus (slows emergency response)
**Best For**: Production outages, critical bugs, system failures
```

#### üß™ **Quality-First Development**
```markdown
**Base**: feature-request.md
**Directives**: testing-focus + (optionally) security-first
**Avoid**: concise-communication during planning phases
**Best For**: Core business logic, APIs, data processing systems
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CONFLICT RESOLUTION GUIDELINES

### Directive Conflicts and Solutions

#### **Conflict 1**: Concise Communication vs. Comprehensive Analysis
**Problem**: Concise directive reduces detail, but complex features need thorough analysis
**Solution**: 
```markdown
# Phase-Based Application
- Phases 1-2 (Investigate/Plan): Standard communication
- Phases 3-5 (Execute/Verify/Retrospect): Concise communication
- Status updates: Always concise
```

#### **Conflict 2**: Speed vs. Quality
**Problem**: Emergency response needs speed, but quality directives slow down
**Solution**:
```markdown
# Urgency-Based Priority
IF urgency = CRITICAL:
  - Skip testing-focus for immediate resolution
  - Add testing-focus for follow-up hardening
IF urgency = HIGH:
  - Streamlined testing (critical paths only)
  - Full security analysis
IF urgency = NORMAL:
  - Full testing + security directives
```

#### **Conflict 3**: Token Limits vs. Comprehensive Coverage
**Problem**: Multiple directives exceed token limits
**Solution**:
```markdown
# Progressive Enhancement
1. Start with core-doctrine.md + base playbook
2. Add highest-priority directive
3. If token budget allows, add secondary directive
4. Document which directives were omitted and why
```

## üéõÔ∏è ADAPTIVE COMBINATION RULES

### Project Context Rules
```markdown
## CONTEXT-BASED SELECTION

**Startup/MVP Context**:
- Prioritize: Speed and core functionality
- Recommended: concise-communication + streamlined playbooks
- Avoid: Complex directive combinations

**Enterprise Context**:
- Prioritize: Security, compliance, documentation
