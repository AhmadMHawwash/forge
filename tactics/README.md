3. **Create Template**: Follow standard directive structure
4. **Test Integration**: Validate with existing playbooks and directives
5. **Measure Effectiveness**: Track impact and value delivery

#### Maintenance Process
1. **Usage Monitoring**: Track adoption and effectiveness metrics
2. **Feedback Collection**: Gather user experience and pain points
3. **Iterative Improvement**: Regular updates based on usage patterns
4. **Deprecation Planning**: Remove unused or ineffective directives

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Selection Guidelines
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with single directives before combining
2. **Measure Impact**: Track effectiveness of each directive
3. **Context Matters**: Choose based on project needs, not preferences
4. **Token Budget**: Consider total prompt size when combining
5. **Team Capability**: Match directive complexity to team experience

### Common Pitfalls
❌ **Over-Engineering**: Using complex directives for simple tasks  
❌ **Directive Conflicts**: Combining incompatible enhancement approaches  
❌ **Token Explosion**: Exceeding reasonable prompt size limits  
❌ **Context Mismatch**: Using directives inappropriate for the situation  
❌ **Change Resistance**: Not adapting directive usage based on outcomes  

### Success Patterns
✅ **Progressive Enhancement**: Start basic, add directives as needed  
✅ **Context Awareness**: Choose directives based on actual requirements  
✅ **Measurement Focus**: Track and optimize directive effectiveness  
✅ **Team Alignment**: Ensure directive choices match team capabilities  
✅ **Continuous Improvement**: Evolve directive usage based on experience
