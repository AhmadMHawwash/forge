## üìã DIRECTIVE OVERVIEW

This optional directive enhances the Feature Development Agent to prioritize **security-by-design, threat modeling, and comprehensive security validation** throughout all development phases.

**Core Foundation:** `@core-doctrine.md` security implications assessments
**Synergistic Directives:** `@testing-focus.md` `@strategic-tactical.md` `@critical-review.md`
**Evidence Standards:** `@standards/evidence-standards.md` security validation formats

## üîí SECURITY PROTOCOL ENHANCEMENT

### MANDATORY SECURITY STANDARDS

**Security-by-Design Principles**
- Implement defense in depth at all system layers
- Apply principle of least privilege to all access controls
- Validate all inputs and sanitize all outputs
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit

**Threat Modeling Integration**
- Identify and analyze potential attack vectors for every feature
- Assess security implications of all architectural decisions
- Document security requirements alongside functional requirements
- Plan security controls and monitoring for identified threats

**Compliance & Standards Adherence**
- Follow OWASP Top 10 security guidelines
- Implement security headers and HTTPS enforcement
- Ensure GDPR/privacy compliance for data handling
- Apply industry-specific security standards as applicable

## üö® SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE

### VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT
**Discovery Response:**
1. **Immediate Assessment**: Severity classification and impact analysis
2. **Containment**: Implement temporary mitigations if needed
3. **Resolution**: Develop and deploy permanent fixes
4. **Verification**: Confirm vulnerability resolution
5. **Documentation**: Record incident and lessons learned

### SECURITY MONITORING
**Continuous Monitoring:**
- Real-time security event detection and alerting
- Access pattern monitoring and anomaly detection
- Security log analysis and threat intelligence integration
- Regular security assessment and penetration testing
