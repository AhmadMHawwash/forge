# Learnings

Repository-specific knowledge extracted using the `repository-learning` goal.

## What Goes Here

- Library patterns and conventions discovered in analyzed repositories
- Architectural patterns with code evidence
- Framework-specific conventions
- Testing patterns and quality practices

## File Format

Each learning file should include:
- **Source:** Which repository it was extracted from
- **Triggers:** Keywords for prompt-router detection
- **Evidence:** Specific file:line references proving the pattern
- **Patterns & Conventions:** Actionable knowledge

See `goals/repository-learning.md` for the complete template.
