# CONTEXT

Context components add technology-specific and domain-specific knowledge to AI developer profiles. They provide specialized constraints, priorities, and approaches based on your technical stack and business domain.

## 📁 Structure

### 🛠️ `stacks/`
**Technology stack contexts that provide specific technical knowledge and patterns**

- **react-node.md**: React frontend + Node.js backend development patterns
- **python-django.md**: Django web development with Python ecosystem

### 🏭 `domains/`
**Business domain contexts that define requirements and success criteria**

- **e-commerce.md**: Online retail platforms, conversion optimization, catalog management

## 🎯 Usage in Profiles

Context components enhance profiles with specialized knowledge:

```
Complete Profile = Foundation + Enhancements + Context + Operation

Example:
foundation/roles/frontend-developer.md +
enhancements/user-advocate.md +
enhancements/performance-optimizer.md +
context/stacks/react-node.md +
context/domains/e-commerce.md +
operations/feature-request.md
```

## 🎛️ Context Selection Guide

### Choose Stack Based On:
- **Primary technology** you're working with
- **Architecture patterns** you need to follow
- **Tool ecosystem** and development practices
- **Performance and scaling** characteristics

### Choose Domain Based On:
- **Business requirements** and constraints
- **User behavior** and success metrics
- **Technical challenges** specific to the industry
- **Performance and reliability** requirements

## 📋 Context Examples

### E-commerce Frontend
```
stacks/react-node.md +
domains/e-commerce.md
```
**Result**: User-facing features optimized for conversion and performance

### Backend API Development
```
stacks/python-django.md +
domains/e-commerce.md
```
**Result**: Robust backend services with e-commerce business logic focus

## 🔄 Extending Context

**When to add new context files:**
- New technology stacks become primary in your work
- Different business domains require specialized knowledge
- Specific technical patterns need dedicated guidance

**Context file guidelines:**
- Focus on constraints, priorities, and decision-making frameworks
- Include domain-specific technical patterns and challenges
- Provide business context that affects technical decisions
- Keep files focused and approximately 50-80 lines
